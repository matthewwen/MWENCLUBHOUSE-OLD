	<h1>Side Project: MWEN Clubhouse</h1>
		<p>The MWENCLUBHOUSE got its name from 
			"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse" 
			(Replace Mickey Mouse with MWEN 
			-> Matthew WEN). 
			The kids show is about a 
			group of friends who uses magical tools from their
			clubhouse to help save their other friends. 
		</p>
		<p>The clubhouse is mostly a playground in the TV show,
			and that is kind of how I am treating this 
			website. I use this website play around with 
			different tools and programming languages.
		</p>
		<p>The website is currently written in GoLang (was C). 
		   This hopefully speeds up production of certain 
		   applications.
		</p>
		<p>Here is some documentation on the website</p>

			vision of this Todo Planner I can make 
			for myself. Once school started, I abonded
			the project until 2nd semester of my

			I am currently working on it.
