			<p>I usually spend most of my coding. However, 
				I also enjoy other activities as well. One 
				thing I enjoy doing is listening to music.
				Music can help me focus on an assignment, 
				motivate me when I am feeling down, or 
				inspire me. In my free time, I enjoy rating
				which songs I enjoy listening too. Below are my
				top listens organized by month.

			<p>I also like running. Running was a late hobby of mine 
				(started in 2017),
				but it is still my favorite outdoor activity. 
				At Purdue, I go on a midnight run called 
				"idk what I am doing, so I'll run far far away"
				(Part of that name was taken from Forrest Gump).
				Those runs are helpful because when I am struggling
				on an assignment, a run helps me refresh my mind. 
				At Purdue, I run 2.5 miles around the circumferance
				of Campus. 
			</p>
			<p> At home, I run 4.5 miles around my neighborhood.</p>

			<p>When I do code, I usually use vscode to code. However
				I also try to use VIM (mostly because of the snippets).
				Here is my vim configurations.
